Product inventory
This project is part of the first RIWI training performance test, it is an inventory system, which allows us to apply the knowledge seen in the first weeks of training, Variabales, Variabales, Arithmetic, conditional operators, cycles, loops, enter others.

Functionalities
Add products to the inv: allow the user to add products with attributes such as Name, price and quantity.
Consult products in inv: search for a product by name and show your details (name, price, quantity).
Update product prices: modify the price of a specific product in the inv.
Eliminate inv products: allow the elimination of a product that is no longer available.
Calculate the total value of the inv: multiply the price by the amount of each product and show the accumulated total

To run this program I added a menu of options for the different functionalities that the program must fulfill, Then before defining each menu option, what I did was perform a number validation for each type of data to be entered, so that it is an accepted number for the function, then each menu function began to be defined, so that it can work properly for the user.
Remember that one of the program's main functions is adding new products. Therefore, we can do the following:

Enter new products with their name, price, and quantity.
With the products already admitted, check the total inventory.
Now delete one of the products.
Finally, review the total inventory to confirm that the program is performing its functions: adding, deleting, and using inventory correctly.
